**Polatory** is a fast and memory-efficient framework for RBF (radial basis function) interpolation.

NOTE: This is a pre-release version. APIs are subject to change without notice.

## Features

- Fast spline surface reconstruction from 2.5D/3D point cloud
- Fast interpolation of 1D/2D/3D scattered data (kriging prediction)
- Meshing isosurfaces
- Supports large number (millions) of input points
- Supports inequality constraints
- [List of available RBFs](https://github.com/polatory/polatory/wiki/List-of-Available-RBFs)

### Supported Compilers

Polatory requires a C++ compiler that supports C++20 and OpenMP 2.0.

### Kriging via RBF Interpolation ([Benchmark](https://github.com/polatory/polatory/wiki/Benchmark))

Polatory can perform kriging prediction via RBF interpolation (dual kriging). Although different terminologies are used, both methods produce the same results. Here is the correspondence between them:

| Kriging                                      | RBF interpolation                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Prediction                                   | Interpolation (fitting + evaluation)                  |
| Covariance function                          | RBF, positive definite                                |
| Generalized covariance function of order _k_ | RBF, conditionally positive definite of order _k_ + 1 |
| Nugget effect model                          | Spline smoothing                                      |
| Simple kriging                               | Interpolant with no polynomial                        |
| Ordinary kriging                             | Interpolant with polynomial of degree 0               |
| Universal kriging                            | Interpolant with polynomial of degree ≥ 1             |
| Weights                                      | (Not computed)                                        |
| Kriging variance                             | (Not computed)                                        |

A limited number of covariance functions are supported. See the [list of available RBFs](https://github.com/polatory/polatory/wiki/List-of-Available-RBFs) for details.
