 * @mainpage ScalFmm
 * Scalfmm is an opensource fast multipole library that used several kernels (Chebyshev, Spherical Harmonics, Taylor, ...).
 * It uses OpenMP and MPI to be parallized.
 *
 * You can find some useful documents in scalfmm/Doc.
 * We recommand beginner to have a look to examples in scalfmm/Tests/Utils.
 * Then, once the design of the application is known, having a look to real tests should be possible.
